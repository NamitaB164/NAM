Project Description

This project aims to create a chatbot-storyteller designed specifically for children who are bedridden or living in hospitals. The chatbot will serve as a companion to bring joy, comfort, and entertainment to children during their hospital stay.

The Problem statement

Children who are bedridden or living in hospitals often face emotional and psychological challenges due to prolonged stays and limited social interaction.

The Solution

To bring a sense of comfort and entertainment to these children, we aim to build a chatbot-storyteller that:

  1. Engages Children: A kid-friendly chatbot that provides valuable facts along with the answers to their queries.
  2. Offers Choice: Allows children to choose stories from various genres (e.g., adventure, fantasy, comedy) and select their favorite characters for interaction(additional feature).
  3. Supports Narration: Stories can be narrated by real people or auto-narrated during upload.(Additional feature)
  4. Catches Attention: Features a colorful, kid-friendly UI designed to attract and entertain children.
    
   This chatbot will serve as a companion to brighten their day, spark imagination, and provide a sense of normalcy during their hospital stay.
